 🤖 AI Model — PointNet Segmentation

 Architecture: `PointNetSeg`
A point cloud segmentation neural network adapted from the original PointNet architecture.

| Layer | Input → Output channels |
|---|---|
| Conv1d + BatchNorm | 3 → 64 |
| Conv1d + BatchNorm | 64 → 128 |
| Conv1d + BatchNorm | 128 → 1024 |
| Global Max Pooling | Extracts global feature vector |
| Conv1d + BatchNorm | 1088 → 512 (local + global concatenated) |
| Conv1d + BatchNorm | 512 → 256 |
| Conv1d (output) | 256 → 50 classes |

**Key design**: Local features (64-dim) are concatenated with the global feature (1024-dim) to give each point both local and global context — this is the hallmark of PointNet segmentation.

 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Overall Accuracy | 80.32% |
| Weighted Precision | 82.49% |
| Weighted Recall | 80.32% |
| Weighted F1 Score | 80.72% |
| Total Points Evaluated | 163,840 |
| Output Classes | 50 (tooth IDs + background) |

🔬 How the AI Pipeline Works

1. **Input**: User uploads a `.npz` file containing `points` (Nx3 XYZ coordinates) and optional `labels`
2. **Normalization**: Points are centered and scaled to a unit sphere `[-1, 1]` to remove scale/position bias
3. **Inference**: The PointNet model assigns a class (tooth ID 1–49, or 0 = background/gum) to every point
4. **Centroid computation**: The 3D center of each predicted tooth cluster is calculated in both raw (real-world) and normalized (display) coordinate spaces
5. **Arch curve fitting**: A **2nd-degree polynomial (parabola)** is fitted through all tooth centroids to model the ideal dental arch
6. **Diagnosis**: Rule-based logic compares actual tooth positions vs. the fitted arch

---

🩺 Diagnosis Logic

The `get_diagnosis()` function analyzes three conditions:

1. Crowding (using PCA-based width estimation)
- Each tooth's width is estimated using **PCA on its point cluster** (4× std dev along minor axis ≈ 95% of width)
- Adjacent teeth are compared: if inter-centroid distance < **85% of expected** → crowding flagged

2. Spacing
- If inter-centroid distance > **120% of expected** → spacing flagged

 3. Displacement / Arch Misalignment
- Each tooth centroid's Y-position is compared against the fitted parabolic arch
- If deviation > **2.0 mm** → displacement flagged

 Diagnosis Output Categories
| Condition | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Normal Alignment | No issues detected |
| Mild Crowding | ≥ 1 crowding instance |
| Severe Crowding | ≥ 2 crowding instances |
| Generalized Spacing | ≥ 2 spacing instances |
| Arch Misalignment | ≥ 2 displacement instances |

🔐 Authentication System

The app uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** based authentication.

- Token algorithm: **HS256**
- Token expiry: **8 hours**
- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (compatible with Python 3.13 — passlib was intentionally avoided due to bcrypt>=4 incompatibility)

Default Users

| Username | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `doctor` | `dental123` | doctor |
| `admin` | `admin123` | admin |

> ⚠️ Change the `SECRET_KEY` in `main.py` before deploying to production.

Protected Endpoints
- `POST /predict` — requires valid Bearer token
- `GET /metrics` — requires valid Bearer token
- `GET /health` — public, no auth needed
- `POST /auth/login` — public, returns JWT token

📂 Data Format

Input files must be NumPy `.npz` archives with:
- `points` — shape `(N, 3)`, float32 XYZ coordinates of the 3D scan
- `labels` *(optional)* — shape `(N,)`, integer ground-truth tooth IDs for comparison

Sample test files are included in the `extra testing data/` folder (upper and lower arch scans for multiple patients).

## 👨‍💻 Development Notes

- The `main.py` contains commented-out versions of earlier iterations (without auth, without alignment simulation) preserved for reference
- Point cloud data is subsampled by factor of 5 (`[::5]`) before sending to frontend to reduce payload size
- The frontend uses `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) so the session clears on tab close
